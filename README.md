Neural networks were trained in Google Colab. 4 Neural networks were used which included the following:
1) Imitation learning navigation network: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pPjWzT1VnmUH_LsGoailbk_3GcXWt0oS?usp=sharing
2) Parking ID classification network: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qv2mgB4daZ7MD39iKKkU16R3KSGfusNy?usp=sharing
3) License plate letter classification network: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ONReGHPV4TXgFuL1GIYIzfGi2UkgF3yA?usp=sharing 
4) License plate number classification network: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b86SiDcz5K8Q8g2LAlTJf9nrhdh_QhZy?usp=sharing

Project contributions:
In order to be able to efficiently work together on this project, we decided to divide the problems into two modular sets which could be worked on independently.
Joey worked on the navigation of the robot and the imitation learning network, while Matthew worked on the license plate detection and related neural networks.
